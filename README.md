# Crossfilter-TestDrive
Testing [Crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) following [a tutorial](http://eng.wealthfront.com/2012/09/05/explore-your-multivariate-data-with-crossfilter).

# Disclaimer
**WARNING**: displaying the demo could hang your tab, browser or even your entire computer (since the earlier is _really heavy_ because associated data: ~52.1 MB).
I recommend to save every work in progress at every single computer application which you were working on before checking the demo otherwise you may lose unsaved data.
I also discourage use mobile data to display this demo and look for a wi-fi connection instead.

If once you have **read and understood** this disclaimer you still want to check the demo [enter here](https://dbautistav.github.io/Crossfilter-TestDrive).
