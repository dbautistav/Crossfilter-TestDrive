# Disclaimer
**WARNING**: displaying this web page is _really heavy_ (because associated data: ~52.1 MB).
Your tab, browser or even your entire computer can hang until hard reset and you may lose unsaved data.
I recommend to save every work in progress at every single computer application which you were working on.
I also discourage use mobile data to display this demo and look for a wi-fi connection instead.

If once you have **read and understood** this disclaimer you still want to check the demo [enter here](https://dbautistav.github.io/Crossfilter-TestDrive).
