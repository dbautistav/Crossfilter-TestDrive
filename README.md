# Crossfilter test-drive
Testing [Crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) following two tutorials: [_"explore your multivariate data with crossfilter"_](http://eng.wealthfront.com/2012/09/05/explore-your-multivariate-data-with-crossfilter) & [_"crossfilter tutorial"_](http://blog.rusty.io/2012/09/17/crossfilter-tutorial). Also consulting the [API reference](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference).

# Disclaimer
**WARNING**: displaying the demo could hang your tab, browser or even your entire device (since the earlier is _really heavy_ due to associated data: ~52 MB (~13 MB gzipped)).
I recommend to save every work in progress at every single application which you were working on your device before checking the demo otherwise you may lose unsaved data.
I also discourage use mobile data to access this demo and look for a Wi-Fi connection instead.

If once you have **read and understood** this disclaimer you still want to check the demo, [enter here](https://dbautistav.github.io/Crossfilter-TestDrive).
